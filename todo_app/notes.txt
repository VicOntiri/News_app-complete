In Riverpod, a Notifier is a type of provider that can be used to manage the state of a piece of code that can notify its consumers of changes. 
It is similar to the ChangeNotifier class provided by Flutter, but it is integrated with the riverpod package and can be used in the same way as other providers.

A Notifier provider is created using the NotifierProvider class and it takes a create function that returns an instance of the ChangeNotifier class. 
Here is an example of creating a Notifier provider that stores a counter value:

final counterProvider = NotifierProvider<Counter>((ref) => Counter());

You can use the .watch method on context to read the state of the notifier and the notifyListeners() method provided by ChangeNotifier to notify the consumers of the changes. 
Here is an example of how to use a Notifier provider in a widget:

class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      final counter = context.watch<Counter>();
      return Column(
        children: [
          Text('Counter: ${counter.value}'),
          RaisedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              counter.increment();
            },
            child: Text('Increment'),
          ),
        ],
      );
    }
  }

It is important to note that when you create a NotifierProvider, the notifier will be automatically disposed when it is no longer in use, 
which means that it will stop listening for changes.

In summary, Notifier is a type of provider in Riverpod that allows you to manage the state of a piece of code that can notify its 
consumers of changes. It is integrated with the riverpod package, and it is similar to the ChangeNotifier class provided by Flutter.
