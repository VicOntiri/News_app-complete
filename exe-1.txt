    e. in your main function call the calculateTriangleArea function and store the result in a variable calculatedArea
    f. write a print statement to print out "The area of a triangle with base 9 and height 8 is 36"
    

3. Given a number 100 print out all divisors - it is a number that divides evenly into another number for that number
